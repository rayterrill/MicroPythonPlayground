# MicroPython CheerLights

This is a port of a Cheerlights client using ESP8266 and MicroPython.

Built using a Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 and a Neopixel connected to PIN14.

Checks the ThingSpeak Cheerlights API every 30 seconds to see if a new color has been posted, and sets the NeoPixel accordingly.
